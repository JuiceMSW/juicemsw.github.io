                        <br>
                        I have been working with Java for at least 4 years, as it was my introductory language into CS.
                        <br></br>
                        I am extremely comfortable with Java and have used it in a variety of ways,
                        but mainly have mainly focused on games.

                        I have worked with Python for 3 years.
                        <br></br>
                        Python is great to use in making quick scripts and tools to help my productivity.
                        <br></br>
                        I've also used it in developing web servers and databases.

                        <br></br>
                        I am comfortable using JavaScript and building front-ends to hook up to Python back-ends.

                        C is the language that I have been using throughout my college education.
                        <br></br>
                        C's low level capabilities make it ideal for any OS projects I have done.
                        <br></br>
                        Using C has been integral to my undestanding of the OS and low level processes.

                        C++ has found its use as my middle ground in between Java and C.

                        It has provided me the luxuries of Object Oriented programming while still being at a low enough level that I can still be in control.

                        Parabox is a puzzle game that I am working on with two others in our game development class.
                        The basis of the game is that you are able to reverse time back to the start of a level.
                        This reverses moveable objects in the game, but not the player.  This allows for interesting puzzle mechanics.
                        <br></br>
                        I have mainly worked on implementing the player/camera movement and some of the object movement logic.  I also helped
                        convert each component in a level into an easy to use prefab that makes the turnaround time from level design to level create very fast.
